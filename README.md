# Randomice
An Electronic Dice

## Inspiration
On any occasion, when our cousins or friends come to our place, we sometimes play board games for fun. And there is always a healthy incident of being sneaky or cheating that lifts up everyone's mood. But sometimes, during serious games, we need to be sure that the game is fair, and hence the idea of our project 'Randomice' came into being, where an electronic dice will show random results which will prevent the game from being rigged. 

## What it does
The name Randomice is an amalgamation of the two words 'random' and 'dice'. And just as the name suggests, our project is an electronic adaptation of the physical dice that shows random numbers between one to six. Now this random digit will be shown in the seven-segment display, as well as the animation feel of the rolling dice will be expressed using the LEDs. 

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
At first we were not sure if we were going to build any project at all, since our exams are starting in 
two days, and we had to prepare for that. But then we decided to take a break from studying and build a very simple project during the remaining time of the hackathon, with the sole purpose of learning and exploring. Building this project in under four hours was the biggest challenge of them all. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
If I am to say what our greatest accomplishment was, then it was attempting to build this project in midst of all the other chores we had to do. It is truly fulfilling to complete a project, but we think the real accomplishment lies in the efforts.
